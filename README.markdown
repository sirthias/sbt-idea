**DEPRECATION NOTE (2011-11-23)**

The post referenced below as well as this template repo are _way_
outdated! Rather than setting up a Scala project in IntelliJ IDEA
manually I strongly recommend using the current version of the
[sbt-idea-plugin](https://github.com/mpeltonen/sbt-idea)!

-------------------------------------

A template for an integrated SBT + IntelliJ IDEA Scala development setup.  
See [this post](http://www.decodified.com/scala/2010/10/12/an-integrated-sbt-and-idea-scala-dev-setup.html) for an in-depth guide.
